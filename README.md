# Unbeatable TicTacToe

## Python (3.x)

The tic-tac-toe is a game, also known as sticks and stones. It is a two player game.

Initially this was given as a project in CSE101 course to implement a Tic Tac Toe game in Python without using arrays (lists). So, I have added that project in Project branch. Now, I have added GUI functionality to the code using Python and added it in the master branch.

Just run the python file, or checkout the `project` branch. :)
